# Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the likelihood of diabetes using the Pima Diabetes dataset. Various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest, are employed to develop predictive models. The project showcases data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and result visualization using Python and scikit-learn. The goal is to explore different machine learning techniques to create accurate predictions and gain insights into diabetes prediction using real-world data.
### Features
